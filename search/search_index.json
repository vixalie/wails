This interface is implemented by each of the target platforms to provide the platform specific functionality. In some cases, this may do nothing. Once you've added the interface method, ensure each platform implements it. A good example of this is the <code>SetMinSize</code> method.</p> <ul> <li>Mac: <code>webview_window_darwin.go</code></li> <li>Windows: <code>webview_window_windows.go</code></li> <li>Linux: <code>webview_window_linux.go</code></li> </ul> <p>Most, if not all, of the platform specific code should be run on the main thread.
